They're the building blocks of pages that appear on a SharePoint site. You can build extensions using modern script development tools and you can deploy your extensions to modern pages in Office 365 tenants. In addition to plain JavaScript projects, you can build extensions alongside common scripting frameworks, such as AngularJS and React. For example, you can use React along with components from Office UI Fabric React to quickly create experiences based on the same components used in Office 365 natively. Organization \u00b6 This repo is divided up into 2 main sections: samples : Samples around the SharePoint Framework extensions to demonstrate different capabilities and possibilities on the framework. Each sample has it's own dedicated readme file to explain setup instructions and demonstrated capability. tutorials : Tutorials that demonstrate different capabilities and possibilities of SharePoint Framework extensions. Each tutorial has it's own dedicated readme file to explain setup instructions and demonstrated capability. You can head directly to those folders and start looking around if you'd like.
